            <p>
              Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick
              brush and dry thorn forest from the Sahara's southern fringe to
              northern South Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are absent from equatorial areas dominated by moist tropical
              forest.

            <h1 class="page-title"><span>Eating</span> habits</h1>

            <p>
              Lions primarily eat large animals that weigh from 100 to 1,000
              pounds (45 to 453 kilograms), such as zebra and wildebeest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lions also steal kills from hyenas, leopards and other predators.
              At times, they may lose their own catches to hyena groups.

            <h1 class="page-title">In <span>extinction</span></h1>

            <p>
              With fewer than an estimated 25,000 in Africa, lions are listed as
              vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the
              Conservation of Nature, which determines the conservation status
              of species.
            </p>
            <p>
              The survival of the species depends on working with local
              communities that must coexist with lions and recognizing their
              role in protecting them.
